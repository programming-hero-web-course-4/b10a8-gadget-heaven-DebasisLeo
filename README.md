3.‚öõÔ∏è React Fundamental Concepts Used
The project incorporates core React.js concepts for building scalable and maintainable components. Here‚Äôs a list of React fundamentals used:

React Functional Components:

Created reusable functional components like Homepage, Watches, ProductDetails, etc.
React Router:

Implemented react-router-dom for client-side routing, enabling navigation between categories, product details, and homepage.
Props and State Management:

Passed data via props for rendering components dynamically.
Used useState to manage local state (e.g., wishlist and cart functionality).
React Context API:

Implemented Context API to manage global state for Cart and Wishlist.
Hooks:

useState: For local state like wishlist tracking.
useLoaderData: To fetch and display loader-provided data dynamically.
useEffect: To handle side effects like data fetching when needed.

The website uses the following techniques for data handling and management:

1.React Context API:
Used to globally manage Cart and Wishlist functionalities across components.

2.React Router Loader:
Data for components (like product details) is loaded using the useLoaderData hook in combination with React Router's loaders.

3.Local Storage (Optional):
Cart or wishlist data can be optionally stored in localStorage to persist state between page reloads.
